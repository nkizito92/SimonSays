# Welcome to SimoneSays
  
In this game here you will have to do what Simone does, you got 3 lives and each time you fail to copy Simone you lose a life. Zero lives means gameover for you, so try not to fail and get a HighScore. Enjoy the game!!

## Usage

To get started on your `terminal` run `rails s`.
If those commands do not work you may need to run `rails db:migrate` and `rails db:seed` to build the database first. Then you may be able to run the `localhost` with the command `rails s`. 

```ruby

=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.2.3 application starting in development 
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 3.12.2 (ruby 2.6.1-p33), codename: Llamas in Pajamas
* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://localhost:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
 
```
You need to see `localhost:3000` this is what you'll need to run in the background. Next Open up the index.html folder and you see the game waiting for you to click start.
